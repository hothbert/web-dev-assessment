**Website Design**

The colour choices and banner were made to reflect nature since Bishopton is a town with great scenery and wildlife.
The layout was kept simple and organised to make it easy to read and understand, with relevant headings and subheadings.
The navigation consists of just a horizontal navbar since there are only three pages. There are external hyperlinks that lead to sources of images and information.

**Challenges Faced**

One difficulty was finding information and images about my home town. Since i am just from a village there isn't much on the internet about it.
Another challenged i faced was making the banner responsive. I originally had set the picture as the background to the header which was proving to be difficult to work with but the problem was solved by just inserting the image straight in.
Adjusting to the changes made when bootstrap was applied also caused some small challenges, particularly to the nav bar.
